# SpotifyCmdLine
Request and parse spotify api through F#

After reading the blog post at https://sidburn.github.io/blog/2016/04/11/optionals, I wanted to try and build a simple command line application to query the Spotify API.

This includes two modes at the moment
* ArtistDetails
* Album Details of a particular artist
